Provide-Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-Domain
The project is based on providing insights to the revenue team in the hospitality domain

About Challenge:
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. 
They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management,
AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. 
As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. 
However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had hired a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
