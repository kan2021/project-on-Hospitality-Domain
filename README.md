Provide-Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-Domain

The project is based on providing insights to the revenue team in the hospitality domain

About Challenge:
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. 
They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. 
Atliq Grands noticed a loss in their market share and revenue over a few months. 
To understand the cause of this loss, they needed a way to analyze this.



Task:

I created a dashboard in Power BI using three months of data.
With the created dashboard, the Revenue team of Atliq Grands were able to gain insights into their revenue trend. 
This could help regain their revenue and market share by 20% next month.
You can download all relevant documents from the download section.

Create the metrics according to the metric list.
Could you create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders?
Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
Things I learn from this project:

Clean, prepare and connect the datasets
Created measures and added custom columns
Used sync slicers to connect slicers with all the pages
chose specific themes for the dashboard for better visualization
find insights after the EDA process
